Purpose: Use Ruby and Net::SSH to span SSH sessions to Xen Dom0's with commands such as "xm list"


xenquery.rb:
Done:
I would prefer this worked with my ssh keys.
Currently it only works with a password.

I think I'd prefer a simple menu where I choose from a small list of my favorite commands such as: xm list, xen-list-images, xm info, etc


To Do:
I'd like to be able to see the host IP address and DNS name
